Capstone Proposal

	The goal of the website will be to allow users to search for cocktails sourced from The Cocktail DB api.  
    Users will be able to store favorites and leave comments on recipes. The demographic of my intended users is 
    ages 21+ that are interested in making and trying out new recipes. With the Cocktail DB I plan to store 
    cocktail photos, titles, ingredients and instructions. I’ll also be storing user data for login and favorites/comments.
	
    The database will have tables for cocktails, users, favorites and comments. The favorites table will 
    reference a cocktail foreign key and a user foreign key, the comments table will do the same. 
    My initial plan is to populate the database using the api and limit calls after that – possibly once 
    a week or whatever in case there is something added. User passwords will be stored using bcrypt so the actual 
    password isn’t available. A stretch goal would be to allow users to share particular cocktails, whether internally 
    or externally.

	Users will initially be prompted to register/login and then will be redirected to the homepage where the most popular 
    cocktails will be displayed. From there users can search using various methods, or they can click on a recipe that will 
    open up a more detailed page. There they can see everything required and comments left by other users. There will also 
    be a user page for everybody with basic info and any recipes they have marked as favorites for easy viewing later.
